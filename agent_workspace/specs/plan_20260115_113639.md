# Implementation Plan - HOMEase | AI

## Task Understanding
The user wants a comprehensive technical architecture plan to build the HOMEase | AI platform. The key constraint is to replace the original Google Cloud and Firebase stack with a new stack centered on Next.js (using the App Router) and Supabase. The plan must cover all aspects of the platform described in the briefing document, including user roles, the AR assessment with AI analysis, lead generation, contractor matching, payments, and real-time communication.

## Execution Strategy
The technical architecture plan will be executed in a phased, feature-driven approach. Phase 1 focuses on establishing the core infrastructure using Next.js and Supabase, including authentication, database schema, and a CI/CD pipeline. Phase 2 develops the core user journey, from the AR assessment and AI analysis to lead generation and contractor matching. Phase 3 builds the user-facing dashboards and communication tools. Phase 4 layers in monetization with Stripe and provides administrative oversight. This strategy prioritizes building the foundational components first, followed by the core value-generating features, ensuring a solid and scalable architecture. The technology stack is consolidated around Vercel for the frontend and Supabase for all backend services (database, authentication, serverless functions, storage), replacing the original GCP and Firebase stack.
